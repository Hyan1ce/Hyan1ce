### Hi, I'm Hyan1ce 👋

I work on the systems behind **large language models** — how they train, how they run, and how to make them more efficient.  
Currently at **Xi’an Jiaotong University**, focusing on scalable training/inference, scheduling, and system-level optimizations for LLMs.

Before this, I studied **Information Security** at **Shandong University**, with interests in cryptography, secure protocols, and general system security.  
This background shaped how I think about reliability, correctness, and the design of trustworthy systems.

I also spent some time at **Xiaomi**, working on the Android Telephony framework and Phone/InCallUI modules, where I learned to appreciate large codebases and real-world system behaviors
